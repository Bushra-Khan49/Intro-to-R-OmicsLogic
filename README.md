# Intro to R â€“ Omics Data Analysis

This repository contains R projects and code notebooks from my practice sessions as I build proficiency in data visualization, statistical analysis, and omics data handling using R.

## What's Inside:
- R basics: variables, functions, loops
- Data wrangling with `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`
- Hands-on notebooks on exploratory data analysis
- DESeq2 workflow introduction

## Why This Repo?
As a Master's student in Bioinformatics with a background in Biotechnology, I am developing my practical coding skills to support transcriptomic data analysis and biological insight extraction. These exercises are part of my continuous upskilling efforts.

## Skills I'm Practicing:
- R programming
- Transcriptomics workflows (esp. RNA-seq)
- Data storytelling through plots
- Version control and documentation

## Let's Connect!
I'm open to learning, sharing, and collaborating on exciting data-driven biological projects. Feel free to reach out or explore my other repositories as I grow this portfolio.
